    Our Trio found metal bar. This bar includes gold, iron, copper and ore.
    We do not know how much of each metal in the bar.
    But we know what proportion of the various alloys.
    For example: gold and tin proportion is 1/3, gold and iron -- 1/4, gold and tin -- 1/2.
    You should calculate the proportion of gold in the bar.
</p>

<p>
    The proportions are given as a dictionary, where keys are alloys names and values are proportions.
    The alloys' names are presented as strings, which are composed of metals' names separated by dash
    (Ex: "gold-tin", "iron-copper", "iron-gold-tin").
    The proportions are presented as fractions (<strong>fractions.Fraction</strong> date type.

<p>
    You should return proportion of gold in the bar as a fraction (<strong>fractions.Fraction</strong>).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition: </strong> All tests are solvable.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Alloys names and proportions. A dictionary.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Proportion of gold. A fractions.Fraction.
