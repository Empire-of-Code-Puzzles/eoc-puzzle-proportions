A piece of ore can contain various metal including Adamantite (Ad), Titanium (Ti), Iron (Fe) and Copper (Cu).
The piece does not contain any other metal except these.
We do not know the quantity of each metal in the piece, but we do know the proportions of the various alloys.

For example: the adamantite and titanium proportion is 0.5, adamantite and iron -- 0.33, adamantite and copper -- 0.25.
"the adamantite and iron proportion is 0.5" means that adamantite and iron together (their sum, not their ratio!)
are the 0.5 (1/2) of the whole piece (the sum of them all).

You should calculate the proportion of adamantite in the entire piece.
The result should be given in with precious &plusmn;10<sup>-2</sup>.

Analyzer gives results in the next form

`M1+M2=X`

where `M1` and `M2` are metal symbols (Ad, Ti, Fe or Cu), 
`X` is a proportion as a number lesser than 1 (given with precious &plusmn;10<sup>-2</sup>).
Full analyzer log contains three or more such entries separated by commas.
